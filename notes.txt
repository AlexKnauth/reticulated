YIELD:
Yield is an expression, not a statement, though one that can only occur in limited places. 
Example:
>>> def echo(value=None):
...     print("Execution starts when 'next()' is called for the first time.")
...     try:
...         while True:
...             try:
...                 value = (yield value)
...             except Exception as e:
...                 value = e
...     finally:
...         print("Don't forget to clean up when 'close()' is called.")

So to support yields, we will need to pass the ret parameter to expressions.

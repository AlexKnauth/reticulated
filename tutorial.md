Tutorial for Reticulated Python
===============================
Under Construction!
-------------------

This will contain an intro for using Reticulated. It is super under
construction right now.

Getting Set Up
--------------

You need Python 3.2.X or Python 3.3.X installed. To see what version
of Python 3 you have installed, go to the command line and type
`python3 --version`. (Note that the command is Python 3 -- in most
operating systems `python` alone defaults to Python 2.X.) 

You need Reticulated downloaded. Clone the git repo at
https://github.com/mvitousek/reticulated. Place it anywhere on your
machine.

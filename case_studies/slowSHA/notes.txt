Observations:
1. When I add a type annotation to something and I get the type wrong, 
the error message seems to just complain "Return value of incorrect type 
at line LINENUM (expected TYPE)
  a. It might be nice if the error told me what type it *did* get, instead 
  of just telling me I failed to meet its expectations

2. This code has classes that are initialized with some values and then just 
does tons of computational mutation to get the SHA digest. I've added types, 
but it doesn't seem like there are that many places to verify type correctness 
in this style of programming since most of the work is happening in these huge, 
imperative functions (and the inner variables do not have annotations)


3. My syntax highlighting is all screwed up w/ these annotations added, 
   he he (Sublime Text 3).

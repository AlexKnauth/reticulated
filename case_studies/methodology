Notes from the meeting on Friday June 16, 2014

There were questions about what should be done during a case study and what data should be collected. Towards getting more organized and scientific about evaluating Reticulated, we started writing down hypotheses that we can try to validate/invalidate through the experiments and some metrics to go along with them. Also, we noted that we need to better document our methodology regarding editing type annotations and or code.

Hypothesis 1: The Reticulated Type System is so good that for many Python programs, only an average of X% lines of code needs to be changed to obtain fully static programs.
Test: Given a system for Reticulated to report how fully-typed a program is, user types program until fully static and reports % of lines changed
Hypothesis 1': The Reticulated Type System is so good that for many Python programs, only an average of X% lines of code needs to be changed to obtain maximally static programs.
Test:  
Hypothesis: Dynamically typed portions of code should error only as much as the original program would
Hypothesis 2: With the Reticulated Type System, one can almost reach fully static typing by only adding and changing type annotations. In many Python programs, the average ratio of appearances of Dyn in type annotations to the total LOC was X. Also, the average ratio of number of inserted casts to the total LOC was Y.

It would be particularly interesting to see the effect of new type system features on H2, such as generics, occurence typing, and implicit conversions between tuples and lists.

Some papers on GradualTalk have some related experiments.

=====================================


statistics:

How convertable is the code? Quantifyable? Automatically?
Lets you know how far you are away from production

If I infer literals, how many problems do we find

Apply retic to Python programs (superpower walls)

Related to H2:
How many dynamic types are we forced to have
 - do we need major intervention to go from script to program

H3: The user who doesn't want to write type annotations,
Reticulated finds X classes of bugs

What kinds of programs are LEGIT Python programs and WRONG Reticulated programs


Stategy: 

Hypothesis -1: The user gave us a Python 3.2 or 3.3 program
Test -1: Run the program in Python3.2 or 3.3, and understand (at a low level) what it does
Hypothesis 0: Python programs contain basic mistakes that Reticulated can detect
Test 0: Run through Retic without modification
Subconclusion: Even if you don't want to spend any time on types, Reticulated is a first sanity check that detects some classes of errors
Test 1: Type the FUCKIN HELL out of the program, but only adding
type annotations
  For things that you couldn't give a static type to something, why?
  What errors occur? Does it occur when you run it without Reticulated?
   Categorize as below

Hypothesis: Annotations + type inference is sufficient to statically type X% of progranms 



Convertibility: 
How your script is convertible to production software.  Given a
representative set of test cases, analyze the execution on original
and on Retic. 

For all static errors and runtime errors that are not in the original
program, categorize the error as such:
  * Retic bugs
  * Bad type annotations
  * Valid usage of Python that becomes invalid in the presence of
    (reasonable) type annotations
     - Representational mismatches 
     - List covariance
     - etc
     - We need to discover more
     In these cases, is the code construct reasonable for stable
     software? In that case, fix in Reticulated. Else, the construct
     is an obstacle to convertibility.
     
     Categorize and assign a weight based on how hard it is to fix
     Calculate overall convertability of program, profile errors, report
     Eventually, detect these cases independently. 
     Instruct user of his mistakes / bad programming habits that will
     have him stick with scripting world. Some of these mistakes might
     be subtle to spot, and our analysis on errors will tell.
     Propose (semi)automatic solutions / guidelines for fixing errors,
     making code more "production-ready"


Unstaticalizability:

Staticalization Program p can become "more static" program p'. 

Hypotheses: Some behaviors of p are statically rejected by p', some
behaviors differ isomorphically, some behaviors are identical.
